# Programming in Haskell

This repository contains my solutions to the exercises contained within the [_Programming in Haskell_](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/book.html) book by Graham Hutton.

They have been coded while going through the [_FP101x: Introduction to Functional Programming_](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-functional-programming-delftx-fp101x-0) _MOOC_ from Delft University of Technology via edX.
